    <p>Hello! My name is Amisha and I'm a senior in Computer Science. I am excited to learn more about web programming. 
      I had a job where I worked for a family friend who does website development, and I helped build pages using Wordpress. 
      However, with that, I didn't actually have to understand any of the technical background of all of this. 
      Most of the websites were built with Elementor, so I was essentially just dragging and dropping boxes. 
      Sometimes my boss would make me use custom CSS to edit certain things, but I didn't really understand what I was doing. 
      I am looking forward to learning more and actually understanding what is going on behind the scenes when building pages :D
